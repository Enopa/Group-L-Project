# Project Wicked
In this game, you must run through a mysterious spaceship and reach safe room at the end. Beward the monster chasing you and manage your stamina well to reach the end.

It can be played at: https://enopa.github.io/Group-L-Project/build/index.html

## Controls
WASD to move
Left Click (MB1) - Attack
Space - Jump
Left Shift - Sprint (Sprinting uses up your stamina)

## Mechanics
The spaceship's power has run out so there is very limited light. You do however have a light. It will dim over time, so make sure to pick up the yellow batteries scattered throughout the map to power up your lamp. If you lamp runs out of power, your vision will be greatly decreased making it significantly harder to escape, so be wary.
