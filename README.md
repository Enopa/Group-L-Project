# Project Wicked
In this game, you must run through a mysterious spaceship and reach safe room at the end. Beward the monster chasing you and manage your stamina well to reach the end.

It can be played at: https://enopa.github.io/Group-L-Project/build/index.html

(The game should be played in full screen to enable the full UI)

## Controls
WASD to move

Left Click (MB1) - Attack

Space - Jump

Left Shift - Sprint (Sprinting uses up your stamina)

## Mechanics
The spaceship's power has run out so there is very limited light. You do however have a light. It will dim over time, so make sure to pick up the yellow batteries scattered throughout the map to power up your lamp. If your lamp runs out of power, your vision will be greatly decreased making it significantly harder to escape, so be wary.

## Goal
Reach the safe room at the end of the level and hit the panic button to close the doors. Hitting the panic button will proceed you to the next level (not yet implemented)
