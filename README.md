# Project Wicked
In this game, you must run through a mysterious spaceship and reach safe room at the end. Beware the monster chasing you, manage your stamina and lamp battery well to reach the end.

It can be played at: https://enopa.github.io/Group-L-Project/build/index.html

(The game should be played in full screen to enable the full UI)
(Headphones also enhance the experience)

## Controls
WASD to move

Left Click (MB1) - Attack

Space - Jump

Left Shift - Sprint (Sprinting uses up your stamina)

P - Pause

## Mechanics
The spaceship's power has run out so there is very limited light. You do however have a light. It will dim over time, so make sure to pick up the yellow batteries scattered throughout the map to power up your lamp. If your lamp runs out of power, your vision will be decreased making it harder to escape, so be wary.

## Goal
Reach the safe room at the end of the level and hit the panic button to close the doors. 

In each safe room there are terminals that can be interacted with. Read them to uncover mysteries of the ship...

Hitting the panic button will proceed you to the next level.
